# Critical Security Vulnerability in React Server Components

<Callout type="danger">
	**Immediate Action Required:** If you are using React Server Components with
	Next.js, React Router, Waku, or other affected frameworks, you must update
	your dependencies immediately.
</Callout>

On **December 3, 2025**, the React team announced a **critical security vulnerability** affecting React Server Components (RSC). This vulnerability allows for **Remote Code Execution (RCE)** on the server, posing a severe risk to applications utilizing RSC.

## The Vulnerability

The issue lies in how React deserializes requests sent to **Server Functions** (also known as Server Actions). An unauthenticated attacker can craft a malicious HTTP request to any Server Function endpoint. When React processes this request, it can be tricked into executing arbitrary code on the server.

This is a classic **deserialization vulnerability**, but its impact is magnified by the direct exposure of server-side logic in RSC architectures.

### Affected Frameworks

The following frameworks and bundlers are known to be affected as they rely on the vulnerable React packages:

- **Next.js**
- **React Router**
- **Waku**
- **RedwoodJS** (via rwsdk)
- **Parcel** (@parcel/rsc)
- **Vite** (@vitejs/plugin-rsc)

## How to Fix

The React team and framework maintainers have released patched versions. You need to upgrade your framework and React dependencies to the latest secure versions.

### Next.js Users

Update to the latest patch release of Next.js 15 or 16 immediately.

```bash
npm install next@latest react@latest react-dom@latest
# or
bun update next react react-dom
```

### Other Frameworks

Check the official advisory and your framework's release notes for the specific version numbers that include the fix.

## Mitigation

If you cannot upgrade immediately, some hosting providers have implemented temporary mitigations at the infrastructure level to block malicious requests. However, **you should not rely on these mitigations as a permanent solution**. Patching your application is the only way to ensure complete safety.

## Conclusion

Security is a shared responsibility. While RSC offers a powerful new paradigm for building web applications, it also introduces new attack vectors. Stay vigilant, keep your dependencies up to date, and monitor official channels for security advisories.
